# Pastebox: A New Way to Share Texts with Markup, Code, and Formulas
> **[Pastebox](https://pastebox.vercel.app/)** 2.0 got released with tons of new features!


Have you ever wanted to share a piece of text with someone, but found that plain text just wasn't enough to convey the information you wanted to share? Maybe you needed to include some formatting or markup, or perhaps you wanted to embed some code or mathematical formulas. If so, then Pastebox might just be the website for you!

Pastebox is a new website that allows you to write and share texts with markup, code, and mathematical formulas. With Pastebox, you can easily create richly formatted text documents that are perfect for sharing with colleagues, classmates, or anyone else who needs to see what you're working on.

One of the key features of Pastebox is its markup system. With this system, you can add formatting and other markup to your text documents. For example, you can make text bold, italicized, or underlined, or you can use headers and subheaders to create a hierarchical structure for your document. You can also include links and images in your documents, making it easy to share all kinds of information.

Another great feature of Pastebox is its support for code and mathematical formulas. If you need to share some code with someone, you can simply paste it into your document, and Pastebox will automatically format it for you. Similarly, if you need to include a mathematical formula, you can use LaTeX syntax to create it, and Pastebox will render it beautifully.

Sharing your documents with others is easy, too. You can either share a link to your document directly, or you can embed it on another website. And if you want to keep your document private, you can simply set it to be viewable only by people who have the link.

So whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone who likes to share information with others, Pastebox is a great tool to have in your toolbox. With its powerful markup system, support for code and mathematical formulas, and easy sharing options, it's the perfect way to share information in a way that's both elegant and informative. So why not give it a try today and see what you can create!
